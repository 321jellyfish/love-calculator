# love-calculator

This project is a simple "Love Calculator" website. User's input their name and their crushes name. After submitting, the website then returns a message to indicate how much of a match they are!

This website is made with:

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

Making this website allowed me to practice using various string and array methods.

I also enjoyed the challenge of coming up with the idea and implementing it from scratch myself. 

In the future I hope to:

- Remove the unnecessary first submit button

- Make the website responsive

I sourced the very cute calculator icon from Flaticon.
